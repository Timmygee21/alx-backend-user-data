## Introduction  
Authentication is a critical aspect of web application development. It ensures that users are who they claim to be and provides a secure environment to protect personal data. This repository offers a set of authentication mechanisms to help you implement user login, protect sensitive data, and manage user sessions effectively.

# Authentication Mechanisms  
### Basic Authentication  
Basic authentication is a straightforward mechanism where the user provides their credentials (username and password) with each HTTP request. The provided credentials are base64-encoded and transmitted over the network. This repository demonstrates how to implement basic authentication in Python, providing a foundation for securing your APIs and web services.

### Session Authentication  
Session authentication aims to enhance user experience by creating a session token after successful login. This token is then stored on the client-side, typically as a cookie. With each subsequent request, the token is sent along, allowing the server to identify and authenticate the user. This repository showcases how to manage user sessions securely and efficiently using Python.

### User Authentication Service  
To simplify the authentication process, this repository offers a user authentication service. The service provides functionalities like user registration, login, and password recovery. It also includes password hashing to protect user credentials in the database. You can easily integrate this service into your web application for seamless user authentication.

## Getting Started  
To get started with the authentication mechanisms provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/authentication-python.git`

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

```
cd authentication-python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Explore the different authentication mechanisms implemented in the repository and adapt them to your project's needs.

# Usage
This section will provide detailed instructions on how to use each authentication mechanism in your Python projects. Refer to the individual code files and documentation to understand the implementation and configuration.
